Intro
=====
The parsetxt library is my brute-force configuration file library.
At the moment it is read-only.
My email address is collver@peak.org.

Brief explanation of configuration file format
==============================================
The file is strictly line-based and there are no line continuations.
Blank lines and comments are ignored.
Comments are lines that begin with the character ';' or '#'.
Each configuration line has a key and a value.
Each key must be unique, no duplicates allowed.
From the beginning of the line to a '=' character is the key.
From the '=' character to the end of the line is the value.
A key may not contain a '=' character.

Brief explanation of library usage
==================================
Create a variable to hold the structure.
txt_t *txt;

Initialize the variable.
txt = txt_new();

To read a configuration file, open it with fopen.  Pass the file handle.
  FILE *ifp;
  char txtfile[] = "bens.conf";
  ifp = fopen(txtfile, "r");
  txt->read_lines(txt, ifp);

To see if a key exists.
  int n;
  char key[] = "keyname";
  if (txt->find_key(txt, key) == -1) puts("key does not exist");

To get the value of a key.
  char *value;
  value = txt->get_data(txt, key);
  /* get_data returns a pointer to internal data which will be lost
     once the txt structure is destroyed. */
